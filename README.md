In the first part of our project, we took four different datasets from online. These included one for Mortalilty Rate for Air Pollution from WHO, country GDP from Worldbank, World air and water quality from IQAir, and a database with lat/long for countries across the world.
We then did multiple merges of these datasets, cleaning them so that we had the columns we wanted in one table. We also added a weighted mortality rate, which took the mortality rate of each city within the country and multiplied that by what proportion of the country's population that city was.
The data was then loaded into an SQLite database. We created the Flask app which created the endpoint of "heatmap" to pull all of the columns from the database so that it is accessible for the visualization files, thus being the link between the database and webpage.
